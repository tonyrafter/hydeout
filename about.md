# Biography

Tony Rafter is an Experimental Scientist at the [CSIRO Climate Science Centre](https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/OandA/Areas/Assessing-our-climate/Climate-Science-Centre), and has worked in the area of climate extremes for more than a decade.  

His work has used both global climate models (e.g. those provided through the *CMIP3* and *CMIP5* modelling enterprises) and regional downscaling models (*CCAM*, *WRF* and *RAMS*) to examine the potential impact that changes to our climate might have on extremes of climate variables, and in particular on **heavy rainfall**. He has also been heavily involved in studies of projected changes in the frequency and intensity of **Tropical Cyclones** around Australia and the SW Pacific region.  

He has contributed to several large research programs, including:  

- producing climate projections for extreme values of climate variables for the latest [*Climate Projections for Australia*](https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/);  

- producing future projections of Tropical Cyclones in the Australian and Western Pacific regions for the (now defunct) [*Australian Climate Change Climate Program*](http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/Climatechange/) and the [*Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning*](http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/adaptation/international-climate-change-adaptation-initiative/paccsap) programme; and  

- helping to inform the climate change guidance incorporated into the engineer's guide [*Australian Rainfall and Runoff*](http://arr.ga.gov.au/arr-guideline).  

Tony is currently studying towards a PhD, studying convective hazards at the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes](http://www.climateextremes.org.au/) through the [School of Earth Sciences at The University of Melbourne](http://earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/). His research is being carried out under the co-supervision of [A/Prof Todd Lane](https://www.climatescience.org.au/staff/profile/tlane) and [A/Prof Jason Evans](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/ccrc-team/academic-research/jason-evans) at the [Climate Change Research Centre UNSW](http://www.ccrc.unsw.edu.au/) in Sydney.
